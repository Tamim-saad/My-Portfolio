                Hello! I am Tamim Hasan Saad from Dhaka, Bangladesh. I am currently a 4th-year CSE student at
                BUET.<br><br>

                My hometown is Pabna, but I am currently residing in Mirpur, Dhaka. I completed my JSC and SSC from
                Uttara High School and my HSC from Rajuk Uttara Model College.<br><br>
                
                I have a passion for problem-solving and web development. I am deeply interested in learning new
                technologies and contributing to society. I have already learned C, C++, Java, Python HTML, CSS, and SQL for
                database management. I try to participate in coding challenges on platforms like Codeforces and CSES,
                and I use GitHub regularly to share my projects.<br><br>

                I am thrilled to have you visit my portfolio. Feel free to explore my website, and don't hesitate to
                send me any queries through the contact page. <br><br>

            <p>
                I attended Uttara High School and College, located at Uttara. <br><br>

                I completed my PSC, JSC, and SSC exams here, achieving a GPA of 5.00 in each. I was the first boy
                among over 300 students in the day shift from class 8 to class 10 for three consecutive years. <br> <br>

                I am profoundly grateful to my school teachers, who laid a strong foundation for my education. I am
                especially thankful to Mr. Shahnoor Showkat, my math, physics, and chemistry teacher, for his
                exceptional guidance in building my foundational knowledge in these subjects. <br><br>

                Additionally, I made some kind-hearted friends during my school years and cherished every moment spent
                there. I have fond memories of my time at school and appreciate the positive impact it had on my life.

            <p>
                After completing my SSC exam, I enrolled at Rajuk Uttara Model College for my higher secondary
                education. <br><br>

                This was the best period of my student life. I met extraordinary teachers and classmates who
                significantly influenced my academic journey. My respected teachers were always supportive, and my
                classmates were exceptionally talented. The overall environment motivated me to study diligently and
                consistently. <br><br>

                I managed to secure a position within the top 20 in each internal exam at the college. Ultimately, I
                completed my HSC with a GPA of 5.00. <br><br>

                The combination of my dedicated teachers, kind-hearted classmates, and the superb environment created
                some of the best memories of my student life. <br><br>
