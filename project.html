                        Overview:
                    </span>
                    <br>These courses, DSA-I and DSA-II, were completed at BUET and focused on key data structures and
                    algorithms concepts. Each course involved weekly assignments, where classic problems were tackled
                    using various techniques. <br>
                    I thoroughly enjoyed these courses, which provided me with a deep understanding of essential
                    algorithms and problem-solving techniques. Working on these problems individually helped solidify my
                    knowledge and enhance my analytical skills.

                    <br>I am deeply passionate about problem-solving and spend my free time coding solutions. I
                    particularly enjoy the CSES problem set, which includes 300 classic problems ranging from beginner

                    <br>Approach: Each problem is solved with a thorough understanding. For algorithms unknown to me, I
                    first learn the algorithm and then implement it to solve the problem.
